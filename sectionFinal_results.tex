\section{Final results}

\subsection{Results\label{chap:Results}}

The boundary between finite contact angles and complete wetting (defined
as $\theta=\theta_{\infty}=0$) is located between $\Phi=33\%$ and
$\Phi=50\%$. The macroscopic contact angle decreases with $\Phi$
(Figure \ref{fig:theta_mac_phi}) showing a linear behavior for polarities
$\Phi\leq33\%$. (Some studies suggest that there is an abrupt fall
at close to the wetting transition \cite{giovambattista:2007,kanduc:2014a,sedlmeier:2008}).
$\theta_{\infty}$ is independent of the position of the SL-interface
$z_{SL}$, while the line tension depends strongly on it (Figure \ref{fig:tau_phi}):
the line tension is positive when $z_{SL}$ is set at the last peak
of the surface density. But its value is negative for $z_{SL}$ at
the last water density peak or at the Gibbs dividing surface. See
Figure \ref{fig:SL-positions} for two density profiles showing the
$z_{SL}$ positions). Thus, changes in $z_{SL}$ of the order of 0.1
nm may already change the sign of the line tension. Its absolute value
is of the order of $10^{-11}\mathrm{pN}$ to $\mathrm{10^{-12}pN}$.
