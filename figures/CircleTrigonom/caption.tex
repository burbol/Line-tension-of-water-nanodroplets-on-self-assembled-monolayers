\label{fig:Circle-Trigonometry}Trigonometric relations for the determination
contact angle $\theta$ and base radius $r_{b}$. $z$ is the coordinate
perpendicular to the surface, $r_{z}$ the cylindrical radius at $z$
(where $r_{z}(z=0)=r_{b}$), $z_{c}$ the z-coordinate of the circle
center, $R_{c}$ the circle radius (with $\varphi=\theta-90\text{\textdegree}$
the relations are simplified). $R_{c}$ and $z_{c}$ are obtained
from the circle fit and then substituted in the equations on the right.
