\label{fig:Tau-vs-MacAngle}Line tension $\tau$ as a function of
macroscopic contact angle $\theta_{\infty}$. Each symbol indicates
a different z-position of the SL-interface: yellow triangles the first
water density peak, gray circles for Gibbs dividing surface (GDS),
and green squares the last SAM density peak. The red horizontal line
indicates $\tau=0$ pN. The dashed lines are cubic interpolations
of the data points added as a visual guide.
