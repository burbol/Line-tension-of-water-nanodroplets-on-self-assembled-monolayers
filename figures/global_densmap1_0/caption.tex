\label{fig:SL-positions}Density profiles and SL-interface positions
of systems with $\Phi=0\%$ (left, hydrophobic) and $\Phi=33\%$ (right,
hydrophilic). (a) and (b) show the same graph with different proportions.
The blue and gray lines indicate the water and the SAM density, respectively.
Only a small fraction of the SAM density is shown. The vertical lines
mark the three positions of the SL-interface: orange indicates the
first water peak, black the GDS position, and green last SAM peak.
(a) Complete water profile. (b) Region of the SL-interface.
