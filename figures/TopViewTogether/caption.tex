Snapshots of SAM top view and slab simulation. (a) SAM top view.
The oxygen atoms are red, and the carbons yellow. The hydrogen atoms
were removed for clarity. The systems shown have 11\%, 17\%, 33\%
and 66\% -OH coverage. (b) Snapshot of a planar water phase or slab
simulation. Hydrogens are show in white (remaining colors same as
in the left figure). \cite{humphrey:1996}
