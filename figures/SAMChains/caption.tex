\label{fig:SAMstructure}Structure of self assembled monolayers.
The figure has three parts labeled with black capital letters. Carbon
atoms are yellow, hydrogens blue, and oxygens red. \textbf{A}:~alkane
chains that form the SAM. $\mathrm{C_{20}H_{44}}$ is the non-polar
chain with a $\mathrm{-CH_{3}}$ head group, and $\mathrm{C_{20}H_{41}OH}$
is the polar chain with an $\mathrm{-OH}$ head group. \textbf{B}:~top
view of a SAM with an 11\% -OH coverage. C: side view of the SAM.
The chains are tilted by 30\textdegree . \cite{humphrey:1996}
