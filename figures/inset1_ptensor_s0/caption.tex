\label{fig:GDSptensor}GDS determination on planar water systems.
Density profiles of planar water systems with $\Phi=0\%$ (hydrophobic)
and $\Phi=33\%$ (hydrophilic) used for GDS determination. The blue
and gray lines indicate the water and the SAM density, respectively;
the horizontal red line the bulk value; and the vertical red line
the GDS position. The insets show the complete water profile.
