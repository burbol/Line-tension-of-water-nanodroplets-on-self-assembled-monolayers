condition and cut-off radius. (a) Two-dimensional periodic boundary
condition. When a particle reaches one side of the box, it enters
again from the opposite side. (b) Cut-off radius and minimum image
convention. The dashed box around particle 1 has the same size as
the central box and contains the same number of particles. The dashed
circle represents the cut-off radius. Particle 1 interacts with particle
2 and with the periodic image 4E (the interactions with 3E and 5C
are dismissed because of the cut-off). (From Ref. \cite{allen:1989})}\selectlanguage{english}%
