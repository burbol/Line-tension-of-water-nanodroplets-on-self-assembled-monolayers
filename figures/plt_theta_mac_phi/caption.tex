\label{fig:Results}\foreignlanguage{english}{Polarity dependence
of macroscopic contact angle and line tension. The polarity $\Phi$
is measured as the percentage of -OH head groups in the SAM. (a) Macroscopic
contact angle $\theta_{\infty}$ as a function of $\Phi$. The results
for the three SL-interface positions are equal (difference smaller
than symbol size). The red horizontal line marks $\theta_{\infty}=90\text{\textdegree}$,
the boundary between hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. (b) Line
tension $\tau$ as a function of $\Phi$. Each symbol indicates a
different z-position of the SL-interface: yellow triangles the first
water density peak, gray circles for the Gibbs dividing surface (GDS),
and green squares the last SAM density peak. The red horizontal line
indicates $\tau=0$ pN, while the dashed lines are cubic interpolations
of the data points added as a visual guide. }\selectlanguage{english}%
