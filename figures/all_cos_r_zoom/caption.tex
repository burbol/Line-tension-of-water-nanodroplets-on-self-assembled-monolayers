\label{fig:Fitted-modified-Young}Fitted modified Young's equation:
$cos(\theta)$ against 1/$r_{b}$. Each graph corresponds to a different
SAM with polarity $\Phi$ (percentage of -OH coverage). The colors
differentiate the SL-interface position used: orange for the first
water density peak, gray for the GDS and green for the last SAM peak
