\label{fig:snapshot-circle-fit} Circle fit compared to simulation
snapshot. System with $\theta=105{^\circ}$, $\Phi=17\%$, $n_{w}=7000$
(a) Average of 0.5 ns between $t_{0}=25$ ns and $t_{1}=25.5$ ns.
The orange and blue points are the cylindrical radii $r_{z}$ determined
for every z-coordinate (the region with negative radius is shown only
for clarity): the orange points were used for the circle fit (dashed
red). The blue points were dismissed. The three horizontal lines close
to the surface indicate the three SL-interface positions: the orange
line indicates $z_{w}$ (used here as the z-coordinate of the circle
center); the black line indicates $z_{GDS}$, and the green line $z_{SAM}$.
(b) Simulation snapshot of the same system at $t=25$ns.
