\subsection{Simulation configuration}

We simulated sixty systems consisting of ten water droplets with molecule
numbers $n_{w}$ between $10^{3}$ and $10^{4}$ placed on six SAMs
polarities $\Phi=$ 0\%, 11\%, 17\%, 33\%, 50\% and 66\%. As previously
mentioned, we used the GROMOS 53A6 force field together with the SPC/E
water model. The SAMs (excluding $\Phi=$50\%) were originally configured
for a 2007 study performed by Janecek et al. \cite{janecek:2007}.
The SAM alkane chains, $\mathrm{C_{20}H_{44}}$ and $\mathrm{C_{20}H_{41}OH}$,
are tilted by 30\textdegree{} (yielding a vertical height of approximately
2.5 nm) and form hexagonal lattices with a lattice constant of 5{\AA }
(see Figure \ref{fig:SAMstructure}). The different polarities $\Phi$
result from the different proportions of the hydrophobic (CH\textsubscript{3})
and hydrophilic (-OH) head groups, which are evenly distributed as
in Figure \ref{fig:SAM-top-view}. The SAM atoms have fixed positions
(zero degrees of freedom) in all the simulations and no internal interactions
between them are allowed. The bond angles and bond lengths of the
SAM molecules can be found in Table \ref{tab:Bond-lengths} in Appendix
\ref{chap:Simulation-parameters}; Table \ref{tab:Mass-symbol-partial-charge}
shows the masses, partial charges and the LJ-parameters of all the
atoms (including water).

The water droplets are initially shaped as cubical boxes. A short
simulation of the water ``cubes'' alone (without SAM) is first performed
consisting of an energy minimization followed by an 10ps-NVT and a
5ns-NPT equilibration (the main simulation parameters are shown in
Table \ref{tab:param-cubes} in Appendix \ref{chap:Analytical-transformation-of}).
Each droplet is then placed (5{\AA }) above the center of every
SAM surface (on the side where the functional head groups are located),
and an energy minimization is performed followed by an NVT simulation
of 20 ns (Table \ref{tab:params-simulation} in Appendix \ref{chap:Analytical-transformation-of})
that is repeated until the contact angle is equilibrated (40 to 100
ns).

To determine the position of the GDS, shorter simulations were performed
using with the same SAMs but planar water phases or ``water slabs''
instead of water droplets (Figure \ref{fig:PtensorSnapshot}). This
simulations were performed in an NP$_{z}$T ensemble controlling the
pressure in the z-direction (In the following, the vertical direction
perpendicular to the SAM will be the z-coordinate, which will be considered
positive when pointing to the water phase). The simulation parameters
can be found in Table \ref{tab:params-ptensor} in Appendix \ref{chap:Analytical-transformation-of}.
