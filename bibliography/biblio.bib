	Abstract = {VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more ``representations,'' in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

	Abstract = {Self-assembled monolayers with different degrees of molecular chain tilt were prepared on silver by adsorption of amphiphiles containing head groups of varying ``effective'' size: mercapto, carboxyl, biphenylcarboxyl and naphthyl carboxyl groups. The structures of these films were characterized by ellipsometry, reflection absorption IR spectroscopy and contact angle measurement. The chain tilt of the alkyl tail groups depend on the effective head group. The contact angle of hydrocarbon liquid exhibits a clear correlation with the orientation of the terminal methyl group (odd-even effect). The variation in contact angle was rationalized as a result of different exposures of methylene unit in the top 2âˆ¼3{\AA} region of the film.},

	Abstract = {Publisher Summary One can find numerous examples where the computational cost of evaluating long-range interactions is reduced in a rather drastic way. It is simply assumed that the long-range part of the potential is not important. The problem of the long-range interactions is then solved by truncation. This gets rid of the expensive part of the calculation but gives rise to serious inaccuracies. This chapter discusses some of the less draconian (and more reliable) techniques for handling long-range interactions. Such schemes are more expensive than simple truncation, but the advantage is that they respect the long-range character of the forces. The techniques include Ewald summation, fast multi-pole methods, and particle-mesh-based techniques. Of these, the Ewald summation is the most widely used technique.},

@article{fangohr:2000,
	Abstract = {A number of problems arise when long-range forces, such as those governed by Bessel functions, are used in particle--particle simulations. If a simple cutoff for the interaction is used, the system may find an equilibrium configuration at zero temperature that is not a regular lattice yet has an energy lower than the theoretically predicted minimum for the physical system. We demonstrate two methods to overcome these problems in Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. The first uses a smoothed potential to truncate the interaction in a single unit cell: this is appropriate for phenomenological characterisations, but may be applied to any potential. The second is a new method for summing the unmodified potential in an infinitely tiled periodic system, which is in excess of 20,000 times faster than previous naive methods which add periodic images in shells of increasing radius: this is suitable for quantitative studies. Finally, we show that numerical experiments which do not handle the long-range force carefully may give misleading results: both of our proposed methods overcome these problems.},

The potential parameters have been adjusted to fit the position of the first peak in the oxygen-oxygen pair distribution function at room temperature, the experimental density and energy, and the dielectric constant of the liquid. The properties of this potential are compared and contrasted with those of two other commonly used effective pair potentials, namely the SPC and TIP4P potentials, each of which fails to give a good fit to the oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function. Some comparisons are also made with the properties of the flexible SPC water potential and the SPC/E potential that was the first rigid molecule potential to account correctly for the mean field self-polarization. The inter-comparison between these potentials highlights the difficulty of achieving a quantitative fit to the properties of water within the pair potential approximation. Particular attention is given to the dielectric properties of the models.},

	Abstract = {An interface displacement model is employed for calculating the line tension of a contact line where three phases meet. At a first-order wetting transition the line tension reaches a positive and finite limit if the intermolecular potentials decay faster than râˆ’6. In contrast, for non-retarder Van der Waals forces, and forces of still longer range, the line tension diverges at first-order wetting. The boundary tension along the prewetting line is positive and finite. Approaching wetting, it increases (with diverging slope) and converges to the value of the line tension at first-order wetting. Approaching first-order wetting at bulk phase coexistence, the line tension is finite provided the potentials decay faster than râˆ’5, and increases (with diverging slope) towards its limit at wetting. In contrast, at a critical wetting transition the line tension vanishes. Comparison with recent results from alternative microscopic mean-field approximations is favourable.},

	Abstract = {Through a literature review, this paper outlines the current understanding of the drop size dependence of contact angles and line tension of solid-liquid systems. Generally, the drop size dependence of contact angles on solid surfaces have been interpreted in terms of line tension. Owing to the complexity of the contact angle measurements, great discrepancies with respect to the apparent sign and value of line tensions of solid-liquid systems have been reported. The ambiguity regarding the sign and value of line tensions may be caused by the roughness and the heterogeneity of real solid surfaces on which the contact angles are measured. However, for a sessile drop on an ideal solid surface, the line tension is shown to be a positive quantity as required by the condition of stable thermodynamic equilibrium. In addition, two techniques to evaluate line tensions of solid-liquid systems by measuring the dependence of contact angles on the radius of the three-phase contact line are also reviewed.},

For years, researchers have addressed a wide variety of issues concerning contact angles. Some questions have been qualitatively answered; others remain open. In this paper, we focus on three issues which are particularly important for the measurement and use of contact angles: the appropriate definitions and use of macroscopic and microscopic contact angles, a brief survey of the length scales relevant to phenomena controlling contact angles, and the role of vibrations in determining contact angles. We emphasize contact angle issues relevant to heterogeneous surfaces, specifically, ambient surfaces prevalent in nature and industry.},

	Abstract = {Recent progress in the correlation of contact angles with solid surface tensions are summarized. The measurements of meaningful contact angles in terms of surface energetics are also discussed. It is shown that the controversy with respect to measurement and interpretation of contact angles are due to the fact that some (or all) of the assumptions made in all energetic approaches are violated when contact angles are measured and processed. For a large number of polar and non-polar liquids on different solid surfaces, the liquid--vapor surface tension times cosine of the contact angle, Î³lvcosÎ¸, is shown to depend only on the liquid--vapor surface tension Î³lv, and the solid--vapor surface tension Î³sv when the appropriate experimental techniques and procedures are used. Equations which follow these experimental patterns and which allow the determination of solid surface tensions from contact angles are discussed. Universality of these experimental contact angle patterns is illustrated; other reasons which may cause data to deviate from the patterns slightly are discussed. It is found that surface tension component approaches do not reflect physical reality. Assuming the fact that solid surface tension is constant for one and the same solid surface, experimental contact angle patterns are employed to deduce a functional relationship to be used in conjunction with Young's equation for determining solid surface tensions. The explicit form of such a relation is obtained by modifying Berthelot's rule together with experimental data; essentially constant solid surface tension values are obtained, independent of liquid surface tension and molecular structure. A new combining rule is also derived based on an expression similar to one used in molecular theory; such a combining rule should allow a better understanding of the molecular interactions between unlike solid--liquid pairs from like pairs. Existing static contact angles for 34 different types of solid surfaces from Zisman et al. are evaluated in terms of their solid surface tensions using experimental contact angle patterns. A FORTRAN computer program has been implemented to automate these procedures. It is found that literature contact angles do not have to be discarded completely; they can be used to determine solid surface tensions, with caution. The surface tensions for the 34 solid surfaces from Zisman et al. are also reported.},

@article{solomentsev:1999,
	Abstract = {The line tension associated with the three-phase contact line of a liquid drop on a rigid substrate is calculated as the excess free energy per unit length of the contact line relative to the free energy of the drop/substrate system when the interaction between the free liquid interface and the substrate is turned off. To perform this calculation, the interaction energy is treated in the Derjaguin approximation and the microscopic drop profile determined accordingly. An explicit expression for the line tension as a function of the macroscopic contact angle for the case of an infinite drop is obtained as a quadrature over the interaction energy per unit area between planar half-spaces. The magnitude of the line tension is shown to be the product of the free liquid surface tension and the length scale associated with the interaction energy. For attractive interaction energies the line tension is negative but when the interaction has both an attractive component (which must dominate at small separations) and a repulsive component which dominates at larger separations, the line tension can be positive. Some simple physical models of the interaction are considered to illustrate these points. For the case of a finite drop, we show that the concept of line tension as a macroscopic quantity which may be added to the free energy balance, giving rise to deviation from Young's equation for the contact angle, is a valid one in the sense that a full treatment of the microscopic drop shape yields the same macroscopic picture of the drop near contact. The line tension for a finite drop is demonstrated to be the value calculated for the infinite drop to within terms of the order of the ratio of interaction energy range to drop radius. Hence, the treatment of line tension as a macroscopic concept is valid down to drop sizes of the order of the range of the interaction energy. Finally, by applying the Derjaguin approximation in a different (but equally valid) way and deriving an alternate expression for the line tension, we are able to elucidate the range of validity of the approximation itself. Line tensions calculated by these methods would appear to be accurate for contact angles up to âˆ¼20$\,^{\circ}$.},

The choice of systems also provided the opportunity to examine the behavior of the line tension for systems near wetting (i.e., low contact angles).

@article{amirfazli:2004,
	Abstract = {From a thermodynamic point of view, the concept of line tension is on solid ground; it is well recognized and defined. There is a notion in the literature that there is little consensus with regards to magnitude or sign of line tension. Partly, inappropriate comparisons of line tension values may have contributed to the current uncertainty, especially some between theoretical and experimental values. A wide range of reported line tension values may not necessarily be a result of conflicting findings, but it may reflect the diversity of systems studied. However, differences among similar approaches and systems observed are sometimes caused by one or several of the following factors: difficulties in sample preparation, poor experimental techniques, non-equilibrium, or conceptual and theoretical difficulties and over simplifications. It is important to clearly establish the magnitude and sign of line tension as it may determine its relevance to technological applications such as microfluidic systems. This review has examined a wide range of recent and past studies on the subject of line tension. The review classifies line tension studies into theoretical and experimental; it further groups the studies into liquid-liquid-vapor and solid-liquid-vapor systems for each category. The review provides a comparison between similar studies in an attempt to clarify the current status of line tension research. The majority of theoretical line tension studies (excluding the near wetting studies) have estimates for line tension of about 10(-10) N; however, for special cases, values as high as 10(-6) N are also reported. There is less consensus regarding the sign for the line tension as theoreticians often assert that line tension can have either a positive or a negative sign. In experimental studies of liquid-liquid-vapor systems the majority of studies reported positive values for line tension; for film studies, the magnitude of line tension reported was between 10(-9) and 10(-7) N, whereas for studies of liquid lens values as high as 10(-6) N were also reported. The clear majority of studies for solid-liquid-vapor systems reported a positive sign for line tension. In studies involving particles, line tension values ranged from 10(-9) to 10(-6) N. Studies using drop size dependence of contact angles reported values mostly in the span of 10(-9)-10(-6) N; however, a clear majority of the reported values fell in the higher end of the above range. The special topic of line tension near wetting was also studied. While the interface displacement model appears to have brought about consensus with respect to certain aspects of line tension behavior near wetting, this model maybe still too phenomenological to be satisfactory from a more fundamental standing. Experimentalists have just begun studying line tension for systems near wetting, this is encouraging, but more comprehensive studies are needed.},

	Abstract = {A new method for the measurement of apparent contact angles at the global energy minimum on real surfaces has been developed. The method consists of vibrating the surface, taking top-view pictures of the drop, monitoring the drop roundness, and calculating the contact angle from the drop diameter and weight. The use of the new method has been demonstrated for various rough surfaces, all having the same surface chemistry. In order to establish the optimal vibration conditions, the proper ranges for the system parameters (i.e., drop volume, vibration time, frequency of vibration, and amplitude of vibration) were determined. The reliability of the method has been demonstrated by the fact that the ideal contact angles of all surfaces, as calculated from the Wenzel equation using the measured apparent contact angles, came out to be practically identical. This ideal contact angle has been compared with three methods of calculation from values of advancing and receding contact angles.},

	Abstract = {Successive parameterizations of the GROMOS force field have been used successfully to simulate biomolecular systems over a long period of time. The continuing expansion of computational power with time makes it possible to compute ever more properties for an increasing variety of molecular systems with greater precision. This has led to recurrent parameterizations of the GROMOS force field all aimed at achieving better agreement with experimental data. Here we report the results of the latest, extensive reparameterization of the GROMOS force field. In contrast to the parameterization of other biomolecular force fields, this parameterization of the GROMOS force field is based primarily on reproducing the free enthalpies of hydration and apolar solvation for a range of compounds. This approach was chosen because the relative free enthalpy of solvation between polar and apolar environments is a key property in many biomolecular processes of interest, such as protein folding, biomolecular association, membrane formation, and transport over membranes. The newest parameter sets, 53A5 and 53A6, were optimized by first fitting to reproduce the thermodynamic properties of pure liquids of a range of small polar molecules and the solvation free enthalpies of amino acid analogs in cyclohexane (53A5). The partial charges were then adjusted to reproduce the hydration free enthalpies in water (53A6). Both parameter sets are fully documented, and the differences between these and previous parameter sets are discussed.},

Surface chemistry provides the key conceptual framework for both life- and nanoscience, where, fol- lowing the decreased size of the systems under study, the properties are extensively determined by the in- terfacial chemistry of such systems. The rapid growth of these fields have created a demand for chemists with good knowledge of surface chemistry.

The students measure the surface tension of various concentrations of aqueous SDS (Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate) and use this information to study adsorption phenomena. The exercise requires about 2 hours of laboratory time, and approximately 4-8 hours for the data-analysis and preparation of a laboratory re- port.},

	Abstract = {The line energy associated with the triple phase contact line is a function of local surface defects (chemical and topographical); however, it can still be calculated from the advancing and receding contact angles to which those defects give rise. In this study an expression for the line energy associated with the triple phase contact line is developed. The expression relates the line energy to the drop volume, the interfacial energies, and the actual contact angle (be it advancing, receding, or in between). From the expression we can back calculate the equilibrium Young contact angle, theta0, as a function of the maximal advancing, thetaA, and minimal receding, thetaR, contact angles. To keep a certain maximal hysteresis between advancing and receding angles, different line energies are required depending on the three interfacial energies and the drop's volume V. We learn from the obtained expressions that the hysteresis is determined by some dimensionless parameter, K, which is some normalized line energy. The value of K required to keep a constant hysteresis (thetaA-thetaR) rises to infinity as we get closer to theta0 = 90 degrees.},

It was found that the new parameter set performs as well as the previous parameter sets in terms of protein (45A3) and DNA (45A4) stability and that it is better at describing the folding-unfolding balance of the peptide.

Increasing the generality and rigor of known methods and obtaining new relationships make necessary supplementing the previous review of the author [A.I. Rusanov, Surf. Sci. Rep. 23 (1996) 173--247] to provide a fresh insight into the modern higher-level state of surface thermodynamics. A deeper understanding of such basic notions of surface thermodynamics as dividing surface, excess surface stress (surface tension), transversal surface tension, line tension, and mechanical equilibrium is reviewed for curved interfaces. At the same time, the development of the local thermodynamics (including surface layers with a real surface stress) is exhibited with the gateway to mechanochemistry, which is practically a department of surface science for solids. The chemical approach to the thermodynamics of nanoparticles is described and illustrated by examples. Polymorphous transformations in nanoparticles are characterized. New relationships for thin wetting films (on the surface, in slits and pores) are given, and various cases of non-uniform (in thickness) films are analyzed. The modern theory of an equation of state of an adsorbed monolayer is formulated, and the survey of old and new equations of state is given within the hierarchy of approximations.},

	Abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate odd-even chain length dependencies in the wetting properties of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of n-alkanethiols [CH3(CH2)n-1SH] on gold by water and hexadecane. Experimentally, the contact angle of hexadecane on the SAMs depends on whether n is odd or even, while contact angles for water show no odd-even dependence. Our MD simulations of this system included a microscopic droplet of either 256 water molecules or 60 hexadecane molecules localized on an n-alkanethiolate SAM on gold with either an even or odd chain length. Contact angles calculated for these nanoscopic droplets were consistent with experimentally observed macroscopic trends in wettability, namely, that hexadecane is sensitive to structural differences between odd- and even-chained SAMs while water is not. Structural properties for the SAMs (including features such as chain tilt, chain twist, and terminal methyl group tilt) were calculated during the MD simulations and used to generate IR spectra of these films that compared favorably with experimental spectra. MD simulations of SAMs in contact with slabs of water and hexadecane revealed that the effects of these solvents on the structure of the SAM was restricted to the chain terminus and had no effect on the inner structure of the SAM. The density profiles for water and hexadecane on the SAMs were different in that water displayed a significant depletion in its density at the liquid/SAM interface from its bulk value, while no such depletion occurred for hexadecane. This difference in contact may explain the lack of an odd-even variation in the wetting characteristics of water on these surfaces, because the water molecules are positioned further away from the surface and, therefore, are not sensitive to the structural differences in the average orientations for the terminal methyl groups in odd- and even-chained SAMs. In contrast, the differences in the wetting properties of hexadecane on the odd- and even-chained SAMs may reflect the closer proximity of these molecules to the SAM surface and a resulting greater sensitivity to the differences in the terminal methyl group orientations in the SAMs. SAM-solvent interaction energies were calculated during the MD simulations, yielding interaction energies that differed on the even- and odd-chained surfaces by approximately 10% for hexadecane and negligibly for water, in accord with estimates using experimental wetting results.},

The contact angle of a water droplet on a silica surface served as a criterion to tune the intermolecular interactions. The resulting force field was used to study the permeation of water through silica nanopores, illustrating the influence of the surface topography and the intermolecular parameters on permeation kinetics.

	Abstract = {We perform molecular dynamics simulations of water in the presence of hydrophobic/hydrophilic walls at T = 300 K and P = 0 GPa. For the hydrophilic walls, we use a hydroxylated silica model introduced in previous simulations [Lee, S. H.; Rossky, P. J. J. Chem. Phys. 1994, 100, 3334. Giovambattista, N.; Rossky, P. J.; Debenedetti, P. G.; Phys. Rev. E 2006, 73, 041604.]. By rescaling the physical partial atomic charges by a parameter 0 <or= k <or= 1, we can continuously transform the hydrophilic walls (hydroxylated silica, k = 1) into hydrophobic apolar surfaces (k = 0). From a physical point of view, k is the normalized magnitude of a surface dipole moment, and thus it quantifies the polarity of the surface. We calculate the contact angle of water for 0 <or= k <or= 1. We find that, at least for the present homogeneous, atomically flat, and defect-free surface model, the magnitude of the surface dipole correlates with the contact angle in a one-to-one correspondence. In particular, we find that polar surfaces with 0 < k <or= kc = 0.4 are macroscopically hydrophobic; that is, the contact angle is larger than 90 degrees . For the cutoff value k = kc, the magnitude of the dipole moment of the polar silica surface unit is 41% that of the water molecule dipole moment. We also study the water orientation distributions next to the walls (a microscopic property). We find that these distributions also correlate with the contact angle in a one-to-one correspondence. Thus, the structure of confined water, the surface polarity, and the contact angle are in a direct correspondence to each other, and therefore, each quantifies the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the surface.},

To do this they applied generalized Young's equation for the line tension and calculated the interfacial tensions using Li and Neumann's equation [Adv. Colloid Interface Sci. 39, 299 (1992)]. It has been found that, for both unary and binary systems, the line tension is negative and the resulting microscopic contact angle derived from experimental nucleation data is most of the time larger than the macroscopic one. This is in contrast to earlier studies where the influence of line tension has not been accounted for. The values of the three phase contact line tension obtained in this way are of the same order of magnitude as the estimations for other systems reported in literature. The line tension effect also decreases considerably the nucleation barrier.},

The results are what are now believed to be definitive for the model. They include strong numerical evidence for the presence of the logarithmic factors predicted by theory both in the mode of approach of the prewetting line to the triple-point line at the point of the first-order wetting transition and in the line tension itself on approach to that point. It is also demonstrated with convincing numerical precision that the boundary tension on the prewetting line and the line tension on the triple-point line have a common limiting value at the wetting transition, again as predicted by theory. As a by product of the calculations, in the model's symmetric three-phase state, far from wetting, it is found that certain properties of the model's line tension and densities are almost surely given by simple numbers arising from the symmetries, but proving that these are exact for the model remains a challenge to analytical theory.},

The density depletion is found at the interface between hydrophobic dodecanethiol (C12) and hexadecanethiol (C16) SAMs and water and also between hydrophilic SAMs (C12/C11OH) and nonpolar fluids. The results show that the density deficit of a fluid in the boundary layer is not unique to aqueous solid-liquid interfaces but is more general and correlated with the affinity of the liquid to the solid surface. In water the variation of pH has only minor influence, while different electrolytes taken from the Hofmeister series seem to increase the depletion. On hydrophobic SAMs an increase in density depletion with temperature was observed, in agreement with Monte Carlo simulations performed on corresponding model systems. The increase in the water density depletion layer is governed by two effects: the surface energy difference between water and the substrate and the chemical potential of the aqueous phase.},

	Abstract = {We analyze two representative systems containing a three-phase-contact line: a liquid lens at a fluid-fluid interface and a liquid drop in contact with a gas phase residing on a solid substrate. In addition we study a system containing a planar liquid-gas interface in contact with a solid substrate. We discuss to which extent the decomposition of the grand canonical free energy of such systems into volume, surface, and line contributions is unique in spite of the freedom one has in positioning the Gibbs dividing interfaces. Curvatures of interfaces are taken into account. In the case of a lens it is found that the line tension is independent of arbitrary choices of the Gibbs dividing interfaces. In the case of a drop, however, one arrives at two different possible definitions of the line tension. One of them corresponds seamlessly to that applicable to the lens. The line tension defined this way turns out to be independent of choices of the Gibbs dividing interfaces. In the case of the second definition, however, the line tension does depend on the choice of the Gibbs dividing interfaces. We also provide form invariant equations for the equilibrium contact angles which properly transform under notional shifts of dividing interfaces which change the description of the system but leave the density configurations unchanged. It is shown that in order to accomplish this form invariance, additional stiffness coefficients attributed to the contact line must be introduced. The choice of the dividing interfaces influences the actual values of the stiffness coefficients. We show how these coefficients transform as a function of the relative displacements of the dividing interfaces. Our formulation provides a clearly defined scheme to determine line properties from measured dependences of the contact angles on lens or drop volumes. This scheme implies relations different from the modified Neumann or Young equations, which currently are the basis for extracting line tensions from experimental data. These relations show that the experiments do not render the line tension alone but a combination of the line tension, the Tolman length, and the stiffness coefficients of the line. In contrast to previous approaches our scheme works consistently for any choice of the dividing interfaces. It further allows us to compare results obtained by different experimental or theoretical methods, based on different conventions of choosing the dividing interfaces.},

	Abstract = {The relation between drop radius, r, the force to move the three phase contact line and the advancing and receding contact angles Î¸A and Î¸R is studied. To keep the line energy (energy per 2Ï€r, also named line tension) independent of r, the modified Young equation predicts that the advancing and receding contact angles, Î¸A and Î¸R, change considerably with r. As shown by many investigators, Î¸A and Î¸R change negligibly, if at all, with r. We quantify recent evidences showing that the line energy is a function of the Laplace pressure and show that this way the modified Young equation is correct and still Î¸A and Î¸R should hardly change with r. According to our model, the small surface deformation associated with the unsatisfied normal component of the Young equation results in higher intermolecular interactions at the three phase contact line which corresponds to a higher retention force. This time increasing effect is supported by recent experiments.},

	Abstract = {The dynamics and structure of water at hydrophobic and hydrophilic diamond surfaces is examined via non-equilibrium Molecular Dynamics simulations. For hydrophobic surfaces under shearing conditions, the general hydrodynamic boundary condition involves a finite surface slip. The value of the slip length depends sensitively on the surface water interaction strength and the surface roughness; heuristic scaling relations between slip length, contact angle, and depletion layer thickness are proposed. Inert gas in the aqueous phase exhibits pronounced surface activity but only mildly increases the slip length. On polar hydrophilic surfaces, in contrast, slip is absent, but the water viscosity is found to be increased within a thin surface layer. The viscosity and the thickness of this surface layer depend on the density of polar surface groups. The dynamics of single water molecules in the surface layer exhibits a similar distinction: on hydrophobic surfaces the dynamics is purely diffusive, while close to a hydrophilic surface transient binding or trapping of water molecules over times of the order of hundreds of picoseconds occurs. We also discuss in detail the effect of the Lennard-Jones cutoff length on the interfacial properties.},

	Abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are being applied to increasingly complex systems, including those involving small endogenous compounds and drug molecules. In order to obtain meaningful and accurate data from these simulations, high-quality topologies for small molecules must be generated in a manner that is consistent with the derivation of the force field applied to the system. Often, force fields are designed for use with macromolecules such as proteins, making their transferability to other species challenging. Investigators are increasingly attracted to automated topology generation programs, although the quality of the resulting topologies remains unknown. Here we assess the applicability of the popular PRODRG server that generates small-molecule topologies for use with the GROMOS family of force fields. We find that PRODRG does not reproduce topologies for even the most well-characterized species in the force field due to inconsistent charges and charge groups. We assessed the effects of PRODRG-derived charges on several systems: pure liquids, amino acids at a hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface, and an enzyme-cofactor complex. We found that partial atomic charges generated by PRODRG are largely incompatible with GROMOS force fields, and the behavior of these systems deviates substantially from that of simulations using GROMOS parameters. We conclude by proposing several points as "best practices" for parametrization of small molecules under the GROMOS force fields.},

	Abstract = {We study the slow dynamics of water evaporation out of hydrophobic cavities by using model porous silica materials grafted with octylsilanes. The cylindrical pores are monodisperse, with a radius in the range of 1-2 nm. Liquid water penetrates in the nanopores at high pressure and empties the pores when the pressure is lowered. The drying pressure exhibits a logarithmic growth as a function of the driving rate over more than three decades, showing the thermally activated nucleation of vapor bubbles. We find that the slow dynamics and the critical volume of the vapor nucleus are quantitatively described by the classical theory of capillarity without adjustable parameter. However, classical capillarity utterly overestimates the critical bubble energy. We discuss the possible influence of surface heterogeneities, long-range interactions, and high-curvature effects, and we show that a classical theory can describe vapor nucleation provided that a negative line tension is taken into account. The drying pressure then provides a determination of this line tension with much higher precision than currently available methods. We find consistent values of the order of -30 pN in a variety of hydrophobic materials.},

The behaviour of LHS is characterized by P - DeltaV cycles, where P is the pressure applied to the system, and DeltaV its volume change due to the intrusion of the liquid into the pores of the material, or its extrusion out of the pores. Very few dynamic studies of LHS have been performed until now. We describe here a new apparatus that allows us to carry out dynamic intrusion/extrusion cycles with various liquid/porous material systems, controlling the temperature from ambient to 120 degrees C and the frequency from 0.01 to 20 Hz. We show that for two LHS: water/MTS and Galinstan/CPG, the energy dissipated during one cycle depends very weakly on the cycle frequency, in strong contrast to conventional dampers.},

	Abstract = {The structural and interfacial properties of nanoscopic liquid drops are assessed by means of mechanical, thermodynamical, and statistical mechanical approaches that are discussed in detail, including original developments at both the macroscopic level and the microscopic level of density functional theory (DFT). With a novel analysis we show that a purely macroscopic (static) mechanical treatment can lead to a qualitatively reasonable description of the surface tension and the Tolman length of a liquid drop; the latter parameter, which characterizes the curvature dependence of the tension, is found to be negative and has a magnitude of about a half of the molecular dimension. A mechanical slant cannot, however, be considered satisfactory for small finite-size systems where fluctuation effects are significant. From the opposite perspective, a curvature expansion of the macroscopic thermodynamic properties (density and chemical potential) is then used to demonstrate that a purely thermodynamic approach of this type cannot in itself correctly account for the curvature correction of the surface tension of liquid drops. We emphasize that any approach, e.g., classical nucleation theory, which is based on a purely macroscopic viewpoint, does not lead to a reliable representation when the radius of the drop becomes microscopic. The description of the enhanced inhomogeneity exhibited by small drops (particularly in the dense interior) necessitates a treatment at the molecular level to account for finite-size and surface effects correctly. The so-called mechanical route, which corresponds to a molecular-level extension of the macroscopic theory of elasticity and is particularly popular in molecular dynamics simulation, also appears to be unreliable due to the inherent ambiguity in the definition of the microscopic pressure tensor, an observation which has been known for decades but is frequently ignored. The union of the theory of capillarity (developed in the nineteenth century by Gibbs and then promoted by Tolman) with a microscopic DFT treatment allows for a direct and unambiguous description of the interfacial properties of drops of arbitrary size; DFT provides all of the bulk and surface characteristics of the system that are required to uniquely define its thermodynamic properties. In this vein, we propose a non-local mean-field DFT for Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluids to examine drops of varying size. A comparison of the predictions of our DFT with recent simulation data based on a second-order fluctuation analysis (Sampayo et al 2010 J. Chem. Phys. 132 141101) reveals the consistency of the two treatments. This observation highlights the significance of fluctuation effects in small drops, which give rise to additional entropic (thermal non-mechanical) contributions, in contrast to what one observes in the case of planar interfaces which are governed by the laws of mechanical equilibrium. A small negative Tolman length (which is found to be about a tenth of the molecular diameter) and a non-monotonic behaviour of the surface tension with the drop radius are predicted for the LJ fluid. Finally, the limits of the validity of the Tolman approach, the effect of the range of the intermolecular potential, and the behaviour of bubbles are briefly discussed.},

	Abstract = {According to common knowledge, hydrophilic surfaces repel via hydration forces while hydrophobic surfaces attract, but mounting experimental evidence suggests that also hydrophilic surfaces can attract. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations at prescribed water chemical potential we study the crossover from hydration repulsion to hydrophobic attraction for planar polar surfaces of varying stiffness and hydrogen-bonding capability. Rescaling the partial charges of the polar surface groups, we cover the complete spectrum from very hydrophobic surfaces (characterized by contact angles Î¸ â‰ƒ 135$\,^{\circ}$) to hydrophilic surfaces exhibiting complete wetting (Î¸ = 0$\,^{\circ}$). Indeed, for a finite range Î¸adh &lt; Î¸ &lt; 90$\,^{\circ}$, we find a regime where hydrophilic surfaces attract at sub-nanometer separation and stably adhere without intervening water. The adhesive contact angle Î¸adh depends on surface type and lies in the range 65$\,^{\circ}$ &lt; Î¸adh &lt; 80$\,^{\circ}$, in good agreement with experiments. Analysis of the total number of hydrogen bonds (HBs) formed by water and surface groups rationalizes this crossover between hydration repulsion and hydrophilic attraction in terms of a subtle balance: Highly polar surfaces repel because of strongly bound hydration water, less polar hydrophilic surfaces attract because water--water HBs are preferred over surface--water HBs. Such solvent reorganization forces presumably underlie also other important phenomena, such as selective ion adsorption to interfaces as well as ion pair formation.},
