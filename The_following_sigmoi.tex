The following sigmoidal function is then fitted to the radial profile
(see Figure \ref{fig:sigmoid}) yielding the cylindrical radius of
the droplet at every z-coordinate, $r_{z}$, which is also position
of the LG-interface:

\begin{equation}
\rho(z)=\frac{\rho^{b}}{2}(1-\tanh\frac{2(z-r_{z})}{d}),\label{eq:sigmoid}
\end{equation}
where $\rho(z)$ is the density, $z$ the vertical direction perpendicular
to the surface, $\rho^{b}$ the bulk density, and $d$ is the thickness
of the liquid-gas interface.
