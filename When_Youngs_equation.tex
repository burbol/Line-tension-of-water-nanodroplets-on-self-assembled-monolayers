When Young's equation is not fulfilled and $\theta=0$ the liquid
spreads along the solid surface covering the SG-interface completely.
This process is called ``complete wetting''.

\subsection{Modified Young's equation and line tension}

Let $G$ be the free energy of a liquid drop composed of three contributions
according to (see Ref. \cite{weijs:2011}):

\begin{equation}
G=G_{\mathrm{bulk\ volume}}+G_{\mathrm{interfaces}}+G_{\mathrm{contact\ line}}
\end{equation}
 Then, an infinitesimal change in the area at any interface maintaining
the volume constant ($dG_{\mathrm{bulk\ volume}}=0$) yields a variation
$dG$ in the free energy

\begin{equation}
dG=\sum_{k}\gamma_{k}dA_{k}+\tau dL.\label{eq:deriv_free_energy}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_{k}A_{k}$ is the energy of the interface $k$, and
$\tau L$ the energy contribution of the contact line with length
$L$, and $\tau$ the line tension, which is the linear equivalent
of the surface tension.
