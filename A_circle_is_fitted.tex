A circle is fitted to the shape of the droplet using the calculated
$r_{z}$ as in Figure \ref{fig:snapshot-circle-fit}. A density $\rho(z)$
close to the bulk value $\rho^{b}$ is assumed in equation \ref{eq:sigmoid}.
Thus, for low densities, as in the upper and lower regions of the
droplet (or where $\rho(z)=0$), equation \ref{eq:sigmoid} yields
$r_{z}$ that deviate from the curvature of a circle. Therefore, only
the region with $\rho(z)\approx\rho^{b}$ is used in the circle fit
(Note that Figure \ref{fig:Circle-fit} shows the physically impossible
region where the radius $r_{z}<0$). Appendix \ref{chap:Apdx-Python-script}
contains the script used to select the $r_{z}$ that show a circular
curvature and to fit a circle to them. The script also computes the
base radius and the contact angle.
